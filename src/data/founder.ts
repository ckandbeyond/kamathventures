  title: 'Founder, Kamath Ventures',
  bio: [
    "I'm a product builder who loves turning ideas into software people actually use. My journey started at Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center, where I fell in love with the intersection of technology and human experience.",
    "From there, I spent years in the games industry — building social games at Wooga, shipping features on Facebook and Messenger gaming platforms, and leading product at edtech startups like Da Vinci Kidspace and 99math.",
    "Today, I run Kamath Ventures — a one-person venture studio where I build, launch, and grow my own products. My current focus is word games: WordDuel (a real-time multiplayer Wordle) and Daily Word Unscramble (a daily puzzle game). I also wrote a children's book called \"It Gets Better\" about resilience and inner superpowers.",
    "Beyond my own products, I've invested in BeyondOS, a $20M AI entertainment lab, and Fideus, a fintech platform for holdings management. I believe the best products come from builders who care deeply about the people using them.",
